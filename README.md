# vision rewrite

**vision rewrite** is my attempt to fix the [broken code I wrote in 2019](https://github.com/chenPerach/vision2019), my first year in frc.
this project addes more more robust and advanced then the code for many reasons.

* calculates the distance and angles currectly and more accuratly
* overall easier to read and less prone to bugs
* easier to extend the capabilities of the project (because of better use of S.O.L.I.D princples)
* has comments

## TODO
even though this project is much better then the last one there is still much needed work to be done.

* add a deploy script that will copy the project to a raspberry pi and run it on startup
* add a script to change the wifi address to a static one at will
* add a web server that allows to debug and view the image from the robot's wifi
